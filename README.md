## libft

Welcome to libft, a custom C library implementation created as a part of the 42 programming curriculum. This library contains a collection of re-implemented standard C library functions, additional utility functions, and bonus functions to aid in future projects and assignments.

## About

In the libft project, we've implemented various functions categorized as follows:

- Libc Functions: Re-implementations of standard C library functions such as strlen, strcpy, strcmp, etc.

- Additional Functions: Extra utility functions that are not included in the standard C library but are helpful for various programming tasks.
 
- Bonus Functions: More advanced functions that go beyond the basic requirements of the project.

The purpose of this library is to provide a solid foundation for C programming, understanding how libraries work, and improving coding skills.

## Functions

The library includes functions from different categories, such as:

- String manipulation (ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strcmp, etc.).
  
- Memory management (ft_memset, ft_memcpy, ft_memmove, etc.).
  
- Character handling (ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_tolower, etc.).
  
- Linked list manipulation (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, etc.).
  
- And many more.
  
For a full list of functions, please refer to the [libft.h](libft.h) header file.

## Usage

``make`` without bonus functions.

``make bonus`` to compile with bonuses.
